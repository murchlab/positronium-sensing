# Positronium Sensing

Repository for the manuscript [Superconducting antiqubits achieve optimal phase estimation via unitary inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04315). This repo contains the analysis scripts and data generated by the experiment, clarifying which parts of the results are corrected for readout fidelity and which features are intrinsic to the antiqubit-based sensing mechanism introduced in the paper.

## Contents

1. Fisher information analysis
2. Readout integration weights
3. Readout classification based on Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classification Tree
4. Readout fidelity correction based on Iterative Bayesian Update (IBU)

## Preview

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Nevergrad (optional for reproducing the demo ADC dataset)

## Running in Binder
